## 📖 Our Story: Reimagining the Portable Workstation
As professionals working remotely, we were tired of the "keyhole" effect of a single laptop screen. We tried every **laptop screen extender** on the market, but they were either too small (12 inches) or too expensive ($600+). 

We built the **TripleScreenPro** to provide a desktop-class experience that fits in your backpack. By cutting out the middleman, we deliver professional-grade hardware directly to you.
